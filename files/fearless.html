    <h1>Fearless (2008/2021)</h1>
    <section>
      <p> Fearless is the second album by Taylor Swift. It was recorded in 2008 and was released on November 11, 2008 by Big Machine Records. It was written largely by Taylor, with seven of the thirteen written by herself. She also co-produced all the songs with Nathan Chapman, making this her debut as a record producer. Fearless is a country pop album. It mixes electronic guitars with classic country instruments like banjos, fiddles, mandolins, and acoustic guitars. On April 9, 2021, Fearless (Taylor's Version) was released, making it the first re-recorded album by Taylor Swift. The album consists of the re-recorded versions of the 19 tracks from the original, the re-recording of Taylor's 2010 single "Today Was a Fairytale", and six "From The Vault" tracks which were withheld from being released in the original version.
