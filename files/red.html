    <h1>Red (2012/2022  )</h1>
    <section>
      <p>Red,Â released on October 22, 2012 by Big Machine Records, is the fourth album by Taylor Swift. The album's title refers to the intense and "red" emotions that Taylor has experienced during this time. The songs show the complex and conflicting feelings that come from fading romance. On this album, Taylor expanded beyond her traditional country pop sound into more pop, country, and rock songs with folk and electronic elements. On November 12, 2021, Taylor released a re-recorded version of this album through Republic Records, naming it "Red (Taylor's Version"). It includes the re-recorded versions of the 20 songs from the original, a 10-minute-long version of "All Too Well", her own recordings of "Better Man" and "Babe", and six "From The Vault" tracks.
